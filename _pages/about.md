  <h2 class="section-header">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm <span class="about-text">Cheng Wu</span>, a <span class="about-text">data and business analyst</span> who cares about how analysis translates into real-world decisions. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    üìö With a background in <span class="about-text">econometrics and quantitative economics</span> from the <span class="about-text">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</span> and current graduate studies in <span class="about-text">Data Science</span> at <span class="about-text">Columbia University</span>, I work at the intersection of quantitative rigor and practical outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    üíº I‚Äôve applied analytics across <span class="about-text">Markets, Finance, and Social Impact</span>. My work has helped managers improve pricing and demand planning, speed up financial reporting, and identify inequities in education systems. What motivates me most are questions without ready-made answers ‚Äî problems where careful analysis can bring clarity and drive meaningful change.
  </p>
  <p>
    üéØ I focus on three things in my work: <span class="about-text">clarity in communication, rigor in method, and measurable impact in results.</span> 
  </p>
  <p><span class="about-text">Focus areas</span>: market analytics, financial analysis, process improvement, education equity</p>
  <p>üìç <span class="about-text">Toolss</span>: SQL, Python, BI dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, Plotly), Statistics / Econometrics</p>

  <div class="entry">
  <div class="entry-title">Data Scientist Intern ‚Äî Marketing Analytics</div>
  <div class="entry-details">Donglai Natural BioTech Co. Ltd. | June 2024 ‚Äì September 2024 | Remote</div>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      At <span class="about-text">Donglai</span>, I joined the <span class="about-text">marketing strategies team</span> at a time when the company was struggling with <span class="about-text">forecasting demand</span> across dozens of product lines. My role started with <span class="about-text">customer segmentation</span>: I applied clustering models like <span class="about-text">K-Means</span> and <span class="about-text">DBSCAN</span> to uncover groups of buyers with distinct purchasing patterns. These clusters were directly connected to <span class="about-text">SQL-based ETL pipelines</span> for inventory planning, which meant my work could be tested quickly against real stock levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      ü•Ç One highlight of the summer was building <span class="about-text">demand forecasting</span> and <span class="about-text">price elasticity models</span> that managers used to run ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. For example, we simulated price adjustments on seasonal products, which translated into a measurable <span class="about-text">12% increase in order completion rates</span>. I also spent weeks refining workflows with <span class="about-text">Spark</span> and <span class="about-text">Dask</span> to handle millions of transaction records; shaving <span class="about-text">40% off reporting latency</span> meant the team could react faster to market shifts. To make all of this accessible, I built <span class="about-text">interactive dashboards</span> in <span class="about-text">Plotly</span>, <span class="about-text">Dash</span>, and <span class="about-text">Power BI</span>. Watching non-technical managers click through predictive insights and immediately adjust their plans was one of the most rewarding moments of my internship.

  <div class="entry-title">Data Analyst ‚Äî Institutional Finance</div>
  <div class="entry-details">ZheShang Securities Co. Ltd. | May 2023 ‚Äì September 2023 | Hangzhou, China</div>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      At <span class="about-text">ZheShang Securities</span>, I rotated into the <span class="about-text">institutional finance department</span>, where private equity and M&A deals were evaluated at a rapid pace. I was tasked with supporting the screening of <span class="about-text">over 20 transactions</span>, which meant diving into financial statements, market data, and regulatory filings. Using <span class="about-text">multi-factor regression</span> and <span class="about-text">scenario analysis</span>, I helped improve the accuracy of our investment evaluations by about <span class="about-text">25%</span> ‚Äî a difference that directly influenced whether deals moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      üí° A big challenge was <span class="about-text">data fragmentation</span>: portfolio data lived in one system, accounting in another, and managers often spent hours reconciling them. I worked on integrating these into a <span class="about-text">unified SQL/VBA pipeline</span>, which cut reconciliation time by nearly a third and made reporting more reliable. Beyond the technical work, I designed <span class="about-text">scalable portfolio analytics frameworks</span> that benchmarked performance against market indices, which gave our risk team a more consistent way to track exposure. The <span class="about-text">BI dashboards</span> I built for real-time portfolio and risk metrics became a talking point in weekly meetings, giving senior managers timely visibility to adjust allocation strategies and communicate with stakeholders.

  <div class="entry-title">Data Analyst & Lead Coordinator ‚Äî Inclusive Growth</div>
  <div class="entry-details">Innovative Bloom Foundation | May 2019 ‚Äì June 2024 | Shanghai, China</div>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      My work with the <span class="about-text">Innovative Bloom Foundation</span> spanned five years, starting when I was still in high school. I first joined as a volunteer <span class="about-text">math teacher</span> for left-behind children in rural communities, but as I observed the deeper structural challenges these families faced, I began to take on broader responsibilities. Over time, I grew from front-line teaching to <span class="about-text">coordinating programs</span> and ultimately leading <span class="about-text">data initiatives</span> that shaped how the foundation measured and scaled its work.
    </p>
    <p>
      My contribution became twofold: <span class="about-text">data analysis</span> and <span class="about-text">program coordination</span>. I started by structuring survey data ‚Äî often messy, handwritten responses ‚Äî into <span class="about-text">SQL datasets</span> that could be analyzed systematically. This opened the door to building <span class="about-text">dashboards</span> that tracked education access, food security, and health indicators across different villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      üòéOne initiative I‚Äôm proud of was helping launch an <span class="about-text">e-commerce platform</span> for local artisans. I set up real-time monitoring to track sales and logistics, and within a year the platform was supporting <span class="about-text">15 families</span> and increasing artisan household income by about <span class="about-text">30%</span>. These numbers weren‚Äôt abstract; they meant that families could afford school fees or healthcare they previously struggled with.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also applied <span class="about-text">regression analysis</span> to benchmark program outcomes, which guided funding decisions for future projects. Over time, I learned how to <span class="about-text">translate complex outcomes into metrics</span> that stakeholders could act on, ensuring that data wasn‚Äôt just collected, but used to design better interventions.

  <div class="entry-details">UIUC | January 2023 ‚Äì February 2025</div>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
     üßë‚Äçüè´My academic interest in <span class="about-text">inequality research</span> grew out of my five years with the <span class="about-text">Innovative Bloom Foundation</span>, where I worked directly with <span class="about-text">left-behind children</span> in rural China. Seeing how <span class="about-text">lack of funding and resources</span> limited opportunities made me want to study these issues with greater rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Illinois, I focused on quantifying how <span class="about-text">differences in school resources</span> shape <span class="about-text">intergenerational mobility</span>. I applied <span class="about-text">regression analysis</span> and <span class="about-text">propensity score matching (PSM)</span> with socio-economic controls, and engineered <span class="about-text">inequality metrics</span> such as <span class="about-text">funding disparities</span> and <span class="about-text">teacher-student ratios</span> by integrating <span class="about-text">national education and mobility datasets</span>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To make these insights accessible, I built <span class="about-text">dashboards</span> and <span class="about-text">automated reports</span> that highlighted <span class="about-text">geographic gaps</span>, providing evidence that <span class="about-text">policymakers</span> could use when designing support programs.

    <p>
      üè´As part of Professor Powers‚Äô research group on <span class="about-text">childcare policy</span>, I contributed to a project evaluating how <span class="about-text">childcare grants</span> affect families‚Äô economic outcomes. My role was to build the <span class="about-text">technical backbone</span>: integrating <span class="about-text">national surveys and administrative data in R</span>, ensuring accuracy through <span class="about-text">standardization and auto-validation</span>, and preparing reliable datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Methodologically, I applied <span class="about-text">Difference-in-Differences (DiD)</span> and <span class="about-text">Instrumental Variables (IV)</span> to isolate the causal effects of childcare subsidies on <span class="about-text">employment</span>, <span class="about-text">income distribution</span>, and <span class="about-text">child welfare</span>. I also developed <span class="about-text">feature-engineered regression models</span> and created <span class="about-text">interactive R Shiny dashboards</span> that simulated policy impacts in real time, enabling both <span class="about-text">policymakers</span> and the <span class="about-text">public</span> to see how grant structures influenced family well-being.

  <div class="entry-details">UIUC | April 2023 ‚Äì December 2023</div>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      This project was deeply personal: my <span class="about-text">grandmother passed away during COVID-19</span> after being unable to access medicine or a hospital bed. That loss motivated me to study why <span class="about-text">health systems fail during crises</span> and how <span class="about-text">data-driven methods</span> could help prevent similar tragedies. 
    </p>
    <p>
      üè•I evaluated the impact of <span class="about-text">preventive health policies</span> on <span class="about-text">disease incidence</span>, <span class="about-text">mortality</span>, and <span class="about-text">healthcare costs</span>, applying <span class="about-text">quasi-experimental design</span> to isolate effects across demographics. To anticipate shortages, I engineered <span class="about-text">policy exposure scores</span> and <span class="about-text">health metrics</span> from <span class="about-text">WHO</span> and <span class="about-text">CDC datasets</span>, and trained <span class="about-text">predictive models (XGBoost, LSTM, clustering)</span> to identify high-risk populations and forecast long-term outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results were delivered as <span class="about-text">decision-oriented dashboards and reports</span>, providing <span class="about-text">resource allocation insights</span> to improve resilience in future emergencies.

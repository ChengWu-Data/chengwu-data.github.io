  <h2 class="section-header">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm <span class="about-text">Cheng Wu</span>, a <span class="about-text">data and business analyst</span> who cares about how analysis translates into real-world decisions. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    With a background in <span class="about-text">econometrics and quantitative economics</span> from the <span class="about-text">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</span> and current graduate studies in <span class="about-text">Data Science</span> at <span class="about-text">Columbia University</span>, I work at the intersection of quantitative rigor and practical outcomes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôve applied analytics across <span class="about-text">Markets, Finance, and Social Impact</span>. My work has helped managers improve pricing and demand planning, speed up financial reporting, and identify inequities in education systems. What motivates me most are questions without ready-made answers ‚Äî problems where careful analysis can bring clarity and drive meaningful change.
  </p>
  <p>
    I focus on three things in my work: <span class="about-text">clarity in communication, rigor in method, and measurable impact in results.</span> 
  </p>
  <p>üìç <span class="about-text">Focus areas</span>: market analytics, financial analysis, process improvement, education equity</p>
  <p>üìç Tools: SQL, Python, BI dashboards (Power BI, Tableau, Plotly), Statistics / Econometrics</p>

  <div class="entry-title">Data Scientist Intern ‚Äî Marketing Analytics</div>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      At <span class="about-text">Donglai</span>, I joined the <span class="about-text">marketing strategies team</span> at a time when the company was struggling with <span class="about-text">forecasting demand</span> across dozens of product lines. My role started with <span class="about-text">customer segmentation</span>: I applied clustering models like <span class="about-text">K-Means</span> and <span class="about-text">DBSCAN</span> to uncover groups of buyers with distinct purchasing patterns. These clusters were directly connected to <span class="about-text">SQL-based ETL pipelines</span> for inventory planning, which meant my work could be tested quickly against real stock levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      One highlight of the summer was building <span class="about-text">demand forecasting</span> and <span class="about-text">price elasticity models</span> that managers used to run ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenarios. For example, we simulated price adjustments on seasonal products, which translated into a measurable <span class="about-text">12% increase in order completion rates</span>. I also spent weeks refining workflows with <span class="about-text">Spark</span> and <span class="about-text">Dask</span> to handle millions of transaction records; shaving <span class="about-text">40% off reporting latency</span> meant the team could react faster to market shifts. To make all of this accessible, I built <span class="about-text">interactive dashboards</span> in <span class="about-text">Plotly</span>, <span class="about-text">Dash</span>, and <span class="about-text">Power BI</span>. Watching non-technical managers click through predictive insights and immediately adjust their plans was one of the most rewarding moments of my internship.

  <div class="entry-title">Data Analyst Intern ‚Äî Institutional Finance</div>
  <div class="entry-details">ZheShang Securities Co. Ltd. | May 2023 ‚Äì September 2023 | Hangzhou, China</div>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>
      At <span class="about-text">ZheShang Securities</span>, I rotated into the <span class="about-text">institutional finance department</span>, where private equity and M&A deals were evaluated at a rapid pace. I was tasked with supporting the screening of <span class="about-text">over 20 transactions</span>, which meant diving into financial statements, market data, and regulatory filings. Using <span class="about-text">multi-factor regression</span> and <span class="about-text">scenario analysis</span>, I helped improve the accuracy of our investment evaluations by about <span class="about-text">25%</span> ‚Äî a difference that directly influenced whether deals moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big challenge was <span class="about-text">data fragmentation</span>: portfolio data lived in one system, accounting in another, and managers often spent hours reconciling them. I worked on integrating these into a <span class="about-text">unified SQL/VBA pipeline</span>, which cut reconciliation time by nearly a third and made reporting more reliable. Beyond the technical work, I designed <span class="about-text">scalable portfolio analytics frameworks</span> that benchmarked performance against market indices, which gave our risk team a more consistent way to track exposure. The <span class="about-text">BI dashboards</span> I built for real-time portfolio and risk metrics became a talking point in weekly meetings, giving senior managers timely visibility to adjust allocation strategies and communicate with stakeholders.
